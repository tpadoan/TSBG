# La fuga di Marco

Presented at the sharper night 2023 at Immaginario Scientifico, Trieste (Italy), the project is a digital tabletop game, spiritually similar to Scotland Yard.
The player, moving through a graph, has to avoid getting caught by the opponents, controlled by the AI.
The AI only knows the player's initial position and the transports taken to move. 

This other branch of the project uses Q-learning to solve the problem, instead.
